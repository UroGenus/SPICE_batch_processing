# SPICE batch processing

This repository contains scripts for batch processing of raw .bam files using the [SPICE pipeline](https://github.com/demichelislab/SPICE-pipeline-CWL). SPICE is designed to generate a comprehensive view of the genomic landscape of matched tumor and normal samples by leveraging allele-specific information from high quality next generation sequencing data. Specifically, using targeted DNA data (e.g. WES), the pipeline first applies tumor purity and ploidy correction, generates a quantitative measure of aneuploidy (asP), and then calls a series of genomic aberrations, including allele-specific copy number aberrations, SNVs with copy number corrected allelic fractions and indels.
